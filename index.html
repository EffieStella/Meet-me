    <h1>HEY THERE!!!</h1>

    <p>Hi, My name is Ifeoma Oraemesi. You can call me Ify. I am a scientist with a background in the bio-sciences. I am in the middle of a career change so I am currently in school for a diploma in Software Development. Don't ask me how that is
      going because all I can say is that I am at a level where everything still sounds Greek to me but hey, I am gonna get a hang of it as time goes by. At least, that's what I am told.
    </p>
    <p>I am Nigerian. Left home about seven years ago, haven't visited since I left but I have been seeing the world through a different lens.</p>
    <p>This is going to be a webpage about life, struggles, successes and all things fun.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to letting you meet the awesome and amazing Ify. I love learning from people's experiences and I like to share mine because it just might come in handy for someone reading</p>
    <p>I hope you have a great day. God bless you.</p>
